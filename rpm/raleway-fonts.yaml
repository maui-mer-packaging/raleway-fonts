Summary      : An elegant sans-serif typeface
Description  : |
  Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed in a single thin weight.
  It is a display face that features both old style and lining numerals,
  standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics,
  as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif
  typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.
